Sublime Text 3 Snippets
========

Navigate to Sublime Text packages directory.
```shell
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/
```

Clone snippets repo.

### For me
I like to create a symlink to a copy of the repo in my Dropbox so the repo only needs to be updated in one place for all the computers.

```shell
ln -s /Users/billy/Dropbox/Public/snippets snippets
```
